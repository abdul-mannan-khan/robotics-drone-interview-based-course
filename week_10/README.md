# Week 10: Computer Vision for Drones

## Learning Objectives
- Understand camera projection models and calibration
- Implement feature detection (Harris) and matching from scratch
- Estimate homographies using DLT and RANSAC
- Build a simple object detector with HOG features
- Compute stereo depth via block matching
- Implement Lucas-Kanade optical flow
- Integrate components into a complete drone vision pipeline
