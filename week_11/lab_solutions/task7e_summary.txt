====================================================================

Scenario         | PID       | LQR       | MPC
-----------------+-----------+-----------+-----------
Hover            |           |           |
  Rise Time      | Medium    | Fast      | Fast
  Overshoot      | Possible  | Minimal   | Minimal
  Tuning         | 3 params  | Q, R mat  | Q, R, N

Tracking         |           |           |
  Sine RMSE      | Highest   | Medium    | Lowest*
  Phase Lag      | Yes       | Small     | Predictive

Constrained      |           |           |
  Handles well?  | Clip only | Clip only | Native
  Performance    | Worst     | Medium    | Best

Disturbance      |           |           |
  Recovery       | Slow      | Fast      | Fast
  Max Deviation  | Largest   | Medium    | Smallest*

Computation      |           |           |
  Per step       | ~0.001 ms | ~0.01 ms  | ~1-10 ms
  Real-time OK?  | Always    | Always    | Depends on N

* MPC advantage is most pronounced with constraints.
  Without constraints, LQR ~ MPC as horizon -> infinity.

RECOMMENDATION:
- Simple hover/setpoint: PID is sufficient
- Moderate performance: LQR (optimal, guaranteed margins)
- Constraints + trajectory: MPC (best performance)
